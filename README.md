CSM117
======
This is Quanjie Geng, Jonathan Ong, and Ran Gross's CSM117 project "Hunt the Trojans"
It is an android game application. The rules are simple: if you are the cat, you use the map to find the mice and use Bluetooth to capture them; if you are the mouse, you use the map to avoid the cat and run for your life!
