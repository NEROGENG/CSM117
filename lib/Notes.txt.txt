employs blue tooth capture, gps, server client app.

1 hour limit

wifi or data to connect to server.


cat has access to a scan every 3 minutes (15 second interval), shows mice
	sends everyone location, status, game status
	
mice see other mice, can't see cat, only given number representing distance to cat(meters)

server - 


cat
-can see every mice location (long, lat)
-captures using bluetooth (master)
-every capture 
-cat and mice can ping (three?) a minute for each other in (30m?)
	returned actual location on map?
	distance?
	confirmation?

mice
-can see distance to cat, but not on map
-every other mice's position on map
-captured by bluetooth (slave)
-once connected/captured, mice loses. Becomes server to cat and relays data of all other mice? 
- when someone pings
	everyone in range is notified of the person pinging is nearby (location of cat on map is given to all mice if cat pings, otherwise jsut the mouse)
